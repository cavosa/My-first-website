    Urban transformation is an improvement and renovation of urban<br><br>
     environmentwhich become old and shabby over time.<br><br>
 Those changes being made base on their socio-economic and the physical conditions.<br><br>
    Urban Transformation involves changes that a built environment must undergo, <br><br>
    to meet the growing demands and dynamic aspects that affect it. These aspects,<br><br>
    depending on geographical location of the city, include population growth, <br><br>
    climate change and demographics.<br><br>
    Urban Transformation also serves as a means for recognizing and celebrating<br><br>
    the ethnic and cultural diversities that form a city.<h3>
