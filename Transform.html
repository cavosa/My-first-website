    The urban transformation space, that is the Superkilen, wedges through one of the most diverse and socially <br><br>
        challenged neighborhood in Coppenhagen (Nørrebro). It is a mile-long park that commemorates the diversity of <br><br>
        the community through a joint-effort with the 60 different nationalities of the people living in the area – to<br><br>
        be engaged in a sort of collection of global objects found in their places of origin. The park showcase exercise<br><br>
        gear from LA to Islamic tiled fountains in Morocco, curvy benches from Brazil to neon signs from Qatar and Russia. <br><br>
        Each object is accompanied by a stainless steel plaque the describes what the object is and where it is from, and <br><br>
        written in Danish and in the language(s) of the origin.<br><br><br><br>
        Rather than contributing to the stark image of a seemingly homogenous Denmark, the Superkilen park was considered <br><br>
        a surrealist collection of urban diversity that inevitably amplifies the true nature of the local neighborhood.
